      fullProposal: `This proposal implements a sophisticated fee market mechanism that uses AI to optimize transaction fees in real-time.

KEY FEATURES:
- AI-powered congestion prediction (5-10 block lookahead)
- Dynamic fee adjustment based on mempool depth
- User preference learning (speed vs cost optimization)
- Economic equilibrium maintenance
- MEV protection through fee smoothing

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Machine learning model trained on historical congestion patterns
2. Real-time fee calculation engine with 100ms response time
3. User-configurable fee preferences (fast, standard, economic)
4. Fee estimation API for wallet integration
5. Economic incentives for validators to maintain optimal fees

BENEFITS:
- Reduced transaction failures during congestion
- Better user experience with predictable fees
- Improved network efficiency and throughput
- Protection against fee manipulation attacks
- Sustainable economic model for validators`,
